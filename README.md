## What is deadmeat?

Deadmeat is a roguelike game that is heavily inspired by NetHack.
It is powered by the libtcod framework, allowing it to be played
outside the terminal. Deadmeat is controlled via the keyboard only
and uses much of the same controls as NetHack. Pressing 'H' in-game
will bring up the help screen to explain the controls.

## Project status

The project is currently suspended and not in active development.

At this time, the game features 11 classes, 8 races and a diverse set of skills.
The game is playable, but many things are still missing and the game can't be won.
