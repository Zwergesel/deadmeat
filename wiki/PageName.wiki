*max_health* = { Vit stat, health skill }

*attack* = { Dex stat of attacker, Dex stat of defender, armor, weapon to hit, weapon enchantment, tile defender is on, fighting skill, weapon skill, dodge skill, armor skill, dodge of defender, fighting skill of defender }

*damage* = { Str stat of attacker, weapon damage, weapon enchantment, armor, fighting skill, weapon skill, endurance skill, armor skill }
(same or different skills as in attack?)

*possible hit outcomes* = { miss, half damage, full damage, critical hit }


= example 1 =

stats are used for the training rate of a skill
higher Vit makes the health skill easier/faster to train etc.
skills start at 1.00 and increase in small steps

*max_health* = (level `*` health skill)

*attack* = (weapon to hit + weapon enchantment) `*` ((fighting skill + weapon skill)/2) > armor `*` armor skill `*` tile defender is on

*damage* = (weapon damage + weapon enchantment)


*attack value* = accumulated attack skill - accumulated defense 

x = gauss on range (-300, 300) with attack value as mean

x < -70 = miss, -70 < x < 0 = half damage, 0 < x < 175 = full damage, 175 < x = critical hit

mean 0 => miss 25%, half 25%, hit 46%, crit 4%
