*max_health* = { Vit stat, health skill }

*attack* = { (Dex stat of attacker), weapon to hit, weapon enchantment, fighting skill }

*defense* = { (Dex stat of defender), special tile defender is on, dodge skill, (fighting skill + weapon skill? / armor skill?) }

*damage* = { Str stat of attacker, weapon damage, weapon enchantment, armor, fighting skill, weapon skill, endurance skill, armor skill }
(same or different skills as in attack?)

*possible hit outcomes* = { miss, half damage, full damage, critical hit }

*speed* = { armor, armor skill, speed skill?, skill of action }


= example 1 =

stats are used for the training rate of a skill
higher Vit makes the health skill easier/faster to train etc.
skills start at 1.00 and increase in small steps

*max_health* = (level `*` health skill)

*attack* = (weapon to hit + weapon enchantment) `*` ((fighting skill + weapon skill)/2) > armor `*` armor skill `*` tile defender is on

*damage* = (weapon damage + weapon enchantment)


*attack value* = accumulated attack skill - accumulated defense 

x = gauss on range (-300, 300) with attack value as mean

x < -70 = miss, -70 < x < 0 = half damage, 0 < x < 175 = full damage, 175 < x = critical hit

mean 0 => miss 25%, half 25%, hit 46%, crit 4%
