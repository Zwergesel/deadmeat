#summary Everything that needs to be done.

= TODO-List =

== Bug fixes / Issues ==
  * (Alex) Timeline needs a unique tiebreaker
  * Wearing armor should not have an effect before the time it takes to put it on has passed (You begin your dressing maneuver...)
  * Don't allow any additional actions after player death, but still show all pending messages

== Small improvement ==
  * Display player information (health, mana, time, status, points, ...)
  * Choosing an item from the inventory should bring up a list of options
  * Wearing multiple types of armor (hats, shoes, cloaks, hats, gloves, hats, TF2 anyone?)
  * 'T' for taking armor off

== Major improvements ==
  * Fully implement attributes
  * Implement weapon and fighting skill training
  * Implement ranged attacking (targetting system to allow more than 8 directions?)
  * Line of sight for player
  * Line of sight for monsters
  * Changing levels
  * Display unseen items where the player has last seen them even if a monster picked them up
  * Looking at things that are not at the player's location
  * Load monsters and levels from files (not savegame loading, just general monster information)

== Milestones for later / No priority ==
  * Magic system
  * Character creation
  * Random level generation
  * Environment objects: Doors, traps, ...
