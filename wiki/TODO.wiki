  * Changing levels
  * Stairs should be objects, so that they can lie on different grounds (grass, cave, ...)
  * Time to eat should depend on the food
  * Creature::die should work without an instigator
  * Ranged attacks should be able to hit creatures in their path, not just the target
  * Generate monsters with items
  * Let monsters drop their items when they die
  * Stacking of items
  * quiver and use ammo

== Bugs / Issues ==

== Major improvements ==
  * Cursed Items
  * Support all skills
  * Item identification
  * Load level data from save files (possible monsters, possible loot, ...)
  * Environment objects: Doors, traps, ...
  * config file

== Milestones for later / No priority ==
