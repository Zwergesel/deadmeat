#summary Everything that needs to be done.

= TODO-List =

== Test ==
  * Make 'e' eating
  * character information scree (levelup?)

==Bugs/Issues==
  * There's a bug sometimes when opening the character info screen. The game crashes because of a failed assertion in libtcod, where a character is out of range (< 0 or > max_chars).

== Small improvements ==
  * Variable "cursed" in Item
  * Creature::die should work without an instigator
  * Food should rot
  * Time to eat should depend on the food

== Major improvements ==
  * stacking of items
  * Fully implement attributes
  * Implement weapon and fighting skill training
  * Implement ranged attacking (targetting system to allow more than 8 directions?)
  * Changing levels
  * Display unseen items where the player has last seen them even if a monster picked them up
  * Generate monsters with items
  * Let monsters drop their items when they die
  * Load level data from save files (possible monsters, possible loot, ...)
  * Environment objects: Doors, traps, ...
  * config file

== Milestones for later / No priority ==
  * Magic system
  * Character creation
  * Random level generation
