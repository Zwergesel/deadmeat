#summary Everything that needs to be done.

= TODO-List =

== Test ==
  * Changing levels
  * Stairs should be objects, so that they can lie on different grounds (grass, cave, ...)
  * Time to eat should depend on the food
  * Creature::die should work without an instigator
  * Ranged attacks should be able to hit creatures in their path, not just the target
  * Generate monsters with items
  * Let monsters drop their items when they die

== Bugs / Issues ==
  * InventoryTable does not get saved in factory

== Small improvements ==

  * Environment objects: Doors, traps, ...
  * config file

== Milestones for later / No priority ==
